model1.predict_proba(x_test):
It predicts the probabilities for each class for all input samples in x_test.

Example


model1.predict_proba(x_test) = [
    [0.7, 0.3],  # First row: Probabilities for sample 1
    [0.2, 0.8],  # Second row: Probabilities for sample 2
    [0.9, 0.1],  # Third row: Probabilities for sample 3
]


y_probs = [0.3, 0.8, 0.1, ...]

These are the probabilities of the positive class (class 1) for each sample.
